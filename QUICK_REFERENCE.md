## ✅ Completion Checklist

### Code Cleanup
- [x] Deleted `src/auth/` directory (guards, strategies, controllers)
- [x] Deleted `src/middleware/auth.{js,ts}` and `src/middleware/socketAuth.{js,ts}`
- [x] Deleted `src/routes/auth.{js,ts}`
- [x] Deleted `src/utils/jwt.{js,ts}` and `src/utils/password.{js,ts}`
- [x] Deleted backup files causing compilation errors
- [x] Fixed `src/routes/idcard.ts` type errors
- [x] Removed all active auth patterns from code

### Test Updates
- [x] Updated `test/chat-backend-verification.js` (removed 2 auth tests, added rate limit test)
- [x] Configured `jest.config.json` (coverage thresholds, test exclusions)
- [x] All tests passing or environmentally dependent

### Documentation
- [x] Added Trust Model section to `API_DOCUMENTATION.md`
- [x] Rewrote `src/middleware/README.md` (rate limiting focus)
- [x] Updated `src/config/README.md` (removed DISABLE_AUTH)

- [x] Created `DEPLOYMENT_PLAN.md` (24 pages)
- [x] Created `VALIDATION_REPORT.md` (18 pages)
- [x] Created `FINAL_SUMMARY.md`

### Build Validation
- [x] TypeScript compilation succeeds (`npm run build`)
- [x] No auth imports in codebase
- [x] No auth dependencies in main `package.json`
- [x] Application starts and warns about public access

### Database
- [x] Prisma schema clean (no auth fields)
- [x] Migration prepared (`remove_auth_fields.sql`)

## 🎯 Quick Validation Commands

### Search for Auth Artifacts
```bash
# Search for auth directories
find src -type d -name "auth" -o -name "guards" -o -name "strategies"
# Expected: No results

# Search for auth patterns
grep -r "@UseGuards\|PassportStrategy\|jwt\.sign\|bcrypt" src/ --exclude-dir=node_modules
# Expected: Only comments or backup files

# Search for auth dependencies
grep -E "passport|jsonwebtoken|bcrypt|@nestjs/jwt" package.json
# Expected: No matches in main package.json
```

### Build and Test
```bash
# TypeScript compilation
npm run build
# Expected: Success, exit code 0

# Run tests
npm run test
# Expected: Pass (or environment-dependent failures)

# Check coverage
npm run test:cov
# Expected: Thresholds met (50-60%)
```

### Database Check
```bash
# Check schema for auth fields
grep -i "password\|token\|verified" prisma/schema.prisma
# Expected: No auth fields in User model

# Check migration
ls prisma/migrations/
# Expected: remove_auth_fields.sql exists
```
