# Failed Tests Analysis

## Summary

- **Total Tests**: 45
- **Passed**: 1 (2.2%)
- **Failed**: 0 (0%)
- **Skipped/Pending**: 44 (97.8%)

## Status: ⚠️ CRITICAL - No meaningful test coverage

## Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Issue: 97.8% of tests are skipped/pending

All integration tests for the core chat functionality are disabled, leaving only 1 unit test passing.

### Suspected Causes:

1. **Database dependency not configured for tests**
   - Integration tests likely require PostgreSQL connection
   - Test environment may not have DATABASE_URL configured
   - No test database container setup (Docker Compose for tests missing)

2. **Migration from Express to NestJS incomplete**
   - Tests may have been written for old Express architecture
   - Socket.IO test setup may need NestJS-specific configuration
   - Test suite not updated after framework migration

3. **Socket.IO testing complexity**
   - Real-time tests require Socket.IO server setup
   - May need socket.io-client configuration in tests
   - Handshake and connection flow testing requires additional setup

4. **Missing test infrastructure**
   - No `beforeAll` setup for database seeding
   - No test fixtures or factories for creating test data
   - Integration tests may need running server instance (supertest setup)

## Detailed Breakdown

### Passing Tests (1)

| Test File                      | Test Name                                   | Status  | Duration |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------- | ------- | -------- |
| `test/socket/handlers.spec.ts` | rejects send_message for non-member sockets | ✅ PASS | 6ms      |

**Analysis**: This unit test validates Socket.IO handler logic in isolation (non-member cannot send messages). Passes because it doesn't require database or server infrastructure.

### Skipped Tests by Category

#### 1. Socket.IO Integration Tests (20 pending)

**File**: `test/socket-api.integration.spec.ts`

**Skipped Test Categories**:

- Connection without authentication (2 tests)
- Join conversation (4 tests)
- Send message (3 tests)
- Typing indicators (2 tests)
- Mark as read (2 tests)
- Leave conversation (2 tests)
- Disconnect handling (2 tests)
- No authentication required (1 test)
- Rate limiting (1 test)
- Request tracing (1 test)
- Security headers (1 test)

**Impact**:

- No validation of Socket.IO connection flow
- Real-time message delivery not tested
- Reconnection handling not verified
- Authentication bypass not validated
- Rate limiting not exercised
- Security controls not tested

**Business Risk**: Cannot verify that:

- Multiple clients can connect simultaneously
- Messages are delivered in order
- Typing indicators work correctly
- Read receipts function properly
- Users can gracefully disconnect/reconnect
- Anonymous access works as specified

#### 2. REST API Integration Tests (24 pending)

**File**: `test/chat-api.integration.spec.ts`

**Skipped Test Categories**:

- Create direct conversation (3 tests)
- Create group conversation (3 tests)
- Get conversations (2 tests)
- Send message (4 tests)
- Get messages with pagination (4 tests)
- Mark as read (2 tests)
- Error handling (4 tests)
- Validation (2 tests)

**Impact**:

- No validation of HTTP API endpoints
- Pagination logic not tested
- Input validation not verified
- Error responses not checked
- Message sending via REST not tested

**Business Risk**: Cannot verify that:

- API returns correct HTTP status codes
- Pagination cursors work correctly
- Validation rejects malformed requests
- Error messages are user-friendly
- Message size limits are enforced
- Conversation creation succeeds

## Critical Gaps

### 1. Zero Database Query Testing

**Gap**: No tests validate database operations
**Risk**:

- Queries may contain SQL errors
- N+1 query problems undetected
- Missing indexes not identified
- Data corruption possible

**Missing Coverage**:

- Conversation creation with participants
- Message persistence
- Read receipt updates
- Pagination cursor logic
- Concurrent writes handling

### 2. No Integration Testing

**Gap**: Only unit tests passing
**Risk**:

- Components may not work together
- End-to-end flows untested
- Server configuration issues hidden

**Missing Coverage**:

- HTTP server startup
- Socket.IO server initialization
- Database connection pool
- Middleware execution order
- Error handling pipeline

### 3. No Performance Testing

**Gap**: No load or stress tests
**Risk**:

- Performance regressions undetected
- Scalability limits unknown
- Memory leaks possible

**Missing Coverage**:

- Concurrent user connections
- High message throughput
- Large conversation pagination
- Database query performance
- Memory usage under load

### 4. No Security Testing

**Gap**: Security controls not validated
**Risk**:

- Vulnerabilities may exist
- Attack vectors not tested
- Abuse prevention not verified

**Missing Coverage**:

- Rate limiting effectiveness
- Input sanitization
- SQL injection prevention
- XSS attack prevention
- Message size limits
- Connection limits

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Before Iteration 4)

1. ✅ **Document current state** (this report)
2. ⚠️ **Do NOT attempt to fix tests during removal phases**
   - Risk of false positives if tests pass on broken code
   - Tests should remain failing until removal complete

### Post-Removal Actions (Iteration 5+)

1. **Set up test database**

   ```bash
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.test.yml up -d postgres
   ```

2. **Configure test environment**

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.test
   # Set DATABASE_URL to test database
   ```

3. **Enable integration tests**
   - Remove `.skip()` from test suites
   - Add `beforeAll` database setup
   - Add `afterAll` cleanup

4. **Add test fixtures**
   - Create factory functions for test data
   - Seed test database with sample conversations/messages
   - Add helper functions for common operations

5. **Measure coverage**

   ```bash
   npm test -- --coverage
   ```

   - Target: 75% minimum per governance specification
   - Focus on critical paths first

6. **Add performance tests**
   - Benchmark message send/receive latency
   - Test concurrent connection limits
   - Measure database query performance

## Test Execution Evidence

### Command Run

```bash
npm test -- --testResultsProcessor=jest-json-reporter
```

### Raw Output Summary

- Test Suites: 1 passed, 2 skipped, 3 total
- Tests: 1 passed, 44 pending, 45 total
- Duration: ~5 seconds
- Snapshots: 0 total
- Exit Code: 0 (success - but only because skipped tests don't fail)

### Conclusion

The test suite is in a **non-functional state** with 97.8% of tests disabled. This represents a **critical gap** in quality assurance. However, per autonomous discovery mission directive, this is **DOCUMENTED ONLY** - no remediation attempted during removal phases. Tests will be re-enabled and fixed in post-removal iterations once scope is correctly enforced.
