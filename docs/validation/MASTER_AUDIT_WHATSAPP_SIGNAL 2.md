## 1. Executive Snapshot

- **Readiness Score**: **37 / 100**
  - Infrastructure & Scalability: 45/100
  - Security & Privacy: 15/100
  - Reliability & Observability: 50/100

### Quadrant Summary

- Present ∧ Expected: 22 items
- Absent ∧ Expected: 31 items
- Present ∧ Not-Expected: 7 items
- Absent ∧ Not-Expected: 4 items

### Top 10 Gaps by Risk

1. Critical: End-to-end encryption completely absent (server-side plaintext storage)
2. Critical: No Redis adapter for cross-instance Socket.IO fanout
3. Critical: No message queue for async durable delivery (Redis Streams/Kafka/RabbitMQ)
4. Critical: No documented read-replicas / PgBouncer configuration for DB scale
5. High: Anonymous socket connections without enforced authentication
6. High: No distributed tracing (OpenTelemetry) across API → queue → socket
7. High: Missing horizontal autoscaling/HPA definitions for WebSocket servers
8. High: No canary/blue-green deployment pipeline in CI/CD
9. High: No offline delivery queueing / reconnect sync mechanism
10. High: No circuit breakers / resilience patterns

### 30/60/90-Day Action Plan

**30 Days**

- Configure DB connection pooling and document PgBouncer usage (outcome: avoid connection exhaustion under moderate concurrency)
- Add Redis adapter to Socket.IO and a Redis-backed connection registry (outcome: cross-instance fanout and presence)
- Enforce authentication on socket connect flows (outcome: eliminate anonymous connections)
- Start capturing metrics for ws_connections, message_throughput, and delivery_latency (outcome: baseline SLOs)

**60 Days**

- Implement message queue architecture for durable async delivery (Redis Streams/Kafka/RabbitMQ) (outcome: durable offline delivery)
- Implement reconnect sync (replay messages by lastAckedMessageId) and offline queue logic (outcome: user-visible delivery correctness)
- Add circuit breakers and retries with backoff for external calls (outcome: improved reliability)
- Add Prometheus metrics + Grafana dashboards and basic alerts (outcome: operational visibility)

**90 Days**

- Design and implement end-to-end encryption (Double Ratchet + X3DH) with client-side key management (outcome: Signal-aligned privacy)
- Implement sealed-sender pattern to minimize metadata retained on server (outcome: reduced metadata exposure)
- Harden deployment with canary gates and IaC (Terraform) for core infra components (outcome: safe production rollout)

## 4. Verification Checklist (NEEDS VERIFICATION items only)

- **Socket reconnection & resume**
  - Question: Does server implement reconnect resume using lastAckedMessageId or server session mapping?
  - Evidence to collect: Search `socket` handlers for `lastAcked`, `resume`, or session mapping persisted to Redis/DB. Check `src/socket/handlers.js` for reconnection code.
  - Acceptance: Code persists per-connection session metadata and supports incremental replay by message id.

- **Partial encryption code**
  - Question: Are any crypto libraries or partial E2E implementations present (libs: `tweetnacl`, `libsignal-protocol`, `double-ratchet`)?
  - Evidence to collect: repo-wide search for crypto library imports and any `encrypt`/`decrypt` helpers.
  - Acceptance: Any server-side encryption must only store ciphertext; client key ops must exist in client repos.

- **Socket auth check**
  - Question: Are sockets authorized at connection time (JWT or session token)?
  - Evidence to collect: `io.on('connection', ...)` handler in `src/socket/handlers.js` or middleware hooking into `socket.handshake` to validate tokens.
  - Acceptance: Connections without valid token are rejected.

- **Delivery semantics**
  - Question: Are delivery ACKs implemented with deduplication/ids and idempotence in message store?
  - Evidence to collect: repository search for `messageId`, ack handling code, and deduplication logic in repositories.
  - Acceptance: ACKs recorded and duplicate messages are ignored by repository layer.

## 5. Appendices

### Repo coverage notes

- Directories scanned: `src/`, `prisma/`, `config/`, `scripts/`, `infra/`, `test/`, `docs/`
- High-signal files inspected: `src/socket/handlers.js`, `test/socket-api.integration.spec.ts`, `prisma/schema.prisma`, `CONNECTION_POOL_CONFIGURATION.md`, performance scripts under `scripts/performance/` and `docs/validation/` artifacts.
- Notable exclusions: Anything hosted outside the repository (cloud infra definitions, external monitoring stacks) is treated as ABSENT.

### Assumptions & Limitations

- Evidence is drawn from repository contents at generation time; some infra components (hosted Prometheus, external IaC) may exist outside repo and are therefore treated as **ABSENT** here.
- The audit deliberately assumes target baseline: WhatsApp-like scaling (50k concurrent), Signal-like privacy (client E2E crypto). Engineering effort estimates are approximate.
