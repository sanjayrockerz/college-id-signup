# Scope Compliance Report

**Date:** 20 Oct 2025  
**Auditor:** Autonomous code audit specialist  
**Repository:** chat-backend (branch: `transform/iteration-1-module-eradication`)

---

## Executive Summary

- **Overall Status:** ❌ **FAIL** – Residual authentication/ID card and college-domain code remains in the repository. Frontend references persist in configuration and documentation.  
- **Coverage:** Inspected `src/`, `prisma/`, `docs/`, `config/`, `scripts/`, `.github/`, `test/`, environment samples, and historical reports using workspace search tools. Node modules and compiled artifacts were excluded.  
- **Findings:**
  - Auth/ID Card artifacts: **4**
  - College domain artifacts: **3**
  - Frontend references: **3**

Any single finding violates the chat-only mandate; multiple critical issues were discovered.

## Detailed Findings

| Finding ID | Category | Type | File & Line | Pattern / Context | Severity | Recommended Action |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A-001 | Auth / ID Card | NestJS controller | `src/idcard/idcard.controller.ts` (lines 1-210) | `@Controller("idcard")`, `uploadIdCard`, `verifyIdCard` mobile workflow | Critical | Delete `src/idcard` module and associated providers. |
| A-002 | Auth / ID Card | Express router | `src/routes/idcard.ts` (lines 1-220) | `/api/id-card/upload`, Prisma `idCardVerification` CRUD | Critical | Remove Express ID card router and upload pipeline. |
| A-003 | Auth / ID Card | Legacy router | `src/routes/idcard.js` (lines 1-220) | Legacy Express ID card handlers using `req.user` | Critical | Delete legacy JS route file and related middleware references. |
| A-004 | Auth / ID Card | Middleware validation | `src/middleware/validation.ts` (lines 418-455) | `validateIdCardVerification` enforcing collegeName/studentIdNumber | Major | Remove ID card validation helper and dependent routes. |
| C-001 | College Domain | Prisma schema | `prisma/schema.prisma` (lines 15-32) | `verifiedCollegeId`, `collegeName`, `studentIdNumber`, `graduationYear` | Critical | Drop college verification columns from `User` model and migrations. |
| C-002 | College Domain | Configuration doc | `src/config/README.md` (lines 3-8) | "singleton Prisma client implementation for the college chat application" | Major | Update/remove doc to reflect chat-only scope. |
| C-003 | College Domain | Documentation | `docs/ID_CARD_VERIFICATION.md` (multiple sections) | Full specification of ID card verification workflows | Major | Remove documentation for de-scoped feature. |
| F-001 | Frontend | Configuration | `.env.example` (lines 18-25) | `CORS_ORIGIN`, `FRONTEND_URL`, `CLIENT_URL` pointing to UI | Major | Remove redundant frontend env vars or justify via new ADR. |
| F-002 | Frontend | Documentation | `README.md` (lines 193-202) | Dedicated "Frontend" section with setup instructions | Major | Delete or rewrite section to reflect backend-only scope. |
| F-003 | Frontend | Deployment guide | `DEPLOYMENT_PLAN.md` (lines 269-276) | "Step 3.3: Update Frontend" instructions | Major | Trim deployment plan to backend responsibilities only. |

> **Note:** Additional historical reports (`ID_CARD_VERIFICATION.md`, `MOBILE_OPTIMIZATION_REPORT.md`, etc.) also reference removed capabilities; only representative samples are listed to avoid duplication.

## Scan Methodology

- **Tools Used:** Workspace `list_dir`, `file_search`, `grep_search`, and `read_file` utilities (non-terminal) to enumerate directories, detect string patterns, and capture context snippets.  
- **Patterns Queried:**
  - Authentication/ID card keywords: `idcard`, `id-card`, `verification`, `IdCardService`, `idCardVerification`, `AuthRequest`, `auth`, `jwt`, `passport`, `bcrypt`.
  - College domain terms: `college`, `campus`, `student`, `department`, `roll`, `faculty`, `enrollment`.
  - Frontend indicators: `frontend`, `client`, `CORS_ORIGIN`, `FRONTEND_URL`, `CLIENT_URL`, documentation sections referencing UI work.
- **Directories Excluded:** `node_modules/`, `dist/`, `coverage/` (compiled artefacts only used for reference when necessary).  
- **Evidence Collection:** Key excerpts recorded in `/docs/validation/scan-artifacts/` (see attachments).

## Evidence Attachments

- `scan-artifacts/directory-tree.txt` – Enumerates residual directories/files observed.
- `scan-artifacts/search-results.txt` – Snippets documenting each finding with context.
- `scan-artifacts/schema-dump.txt` – Prisma excerpt showing college verification fields.
- `scan-artifacts/env-keys-list.txt` – Environment variables and docs referencing frontend clients.

All evidence files are stored under `docs/validation/scan-artifacts/` for audit trail purposes.

## Compliance Determination

The repository **fails** the chat-only scope mandate. Authentication/ID-card modules, college verification schema, and frontend-oriented configuration/documentation remain. Removal of these artifacts is required prior to declaring the transformation complete.

Next steps (recommended for remediation):
1. Delete `src/idcard`, `src/routes/idcard.*`, and associated validation/utilities; excise Prisma ID card tables/fields and regenerate client.  
2. Purge college-domain fields from user model, migrations, and runtime logic; sanitize documentation.  
3. Eliminate frontend environment variables and documentation, ensuring CORS configuration references only approved upstream services.  
4. Re-run full compliance audit post-cleanup to confirm zero findings.
